        Compliance polices are groupings of Policy Elements. You will likely want to group similar types of commands together for evaluation at Report runtime.

        You can easily add and remove items from a policy using the + and - signs between the select areas on the left and right. Removing or adding an Element will dynamically update any scheduled report.
